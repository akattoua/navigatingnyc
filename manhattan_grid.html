                <p>The borough of Manhattan is designed in a grid between Houston Street and the Washington Heights neighborhood.  The original design was developed by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811.  The grid was developed from the irregular growth of Manhattan streets up to this point.  The area north of Houston was made up of small villages, rural farmland, and the odd estate.  The Commissioners' Plan set-up a grid of 12 north/south avenues and 155 east/west streets that would be constructed over the next 100 years.</p>
                <h4>Why is the Manhattan grid so helpful?</h4>
                <h4>The grid allows you to easily find your way around the city.</h4>
                <ul>    
                    <li>Avenues run north and south while streets run east and west.</li>
                    <li>The number of avenue count up from east to west, and the street numbers climb as you move north.</li>
                    <li>Traffic on the avenues run in alternating directions.  First Avenue traffic drives north, Second Avenue drives south, and so on.  The only exceptions are Third Avenue and Fourth/Park Avenue which traffic driving in both directions.</li>
